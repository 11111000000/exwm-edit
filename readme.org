* Caution
  Recently there seem to be a number of changes in exwm and xelb projects that break some of the behaviors of this package. Until things are fixed I'd recommended pinning the following commits:

https://github.com/ch11ng/xelb/commit/fe1b643e98ea4a87a3eed41b0bbaf6c12dfcfbec
https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/commit/b75c89cae2a1c4c70044f885c44a95fd2f9950dd

** See also [[https://github.com/agzam/exwm-edit/issues/5][#5]]
** In Spacemacs pinning a specific commit version can be done like this:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (xelb :location (recipe :fetcher github
                            :repo "ch11ng/xelb"
                            :commit "fe1b643e98ea4a87a3eed41b0bbaf6c12dfcfbec")
          :step pre)
    (exwm :location (recipe :fetcher github
                            :repo "ch11ng/exwm"
                            :commit "b75c89cae2a1c4c70044f885c44a95fd2f9950dd")
          :step pre)
  #+end_src

* Description
  Edit mode for [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]]

  Similar to [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]]

  except this package is made to work with EXWM
  and it works with any editable element of any app

  The idea is very simple - when you press the keybinding,
  it simulates =C-a= + =C-c= (select all & copy),
  then opens a buffer and yanks (pastes) the content so you can edit it,
  after you done - it grabs (now edited text) and pastes back to where it's started

  Now that opens interesting possibilities, for example:
  - when typing in ChromeDevTools console, you can initiate exwm-edit, then change major mode to whatever your favorite javascript mode is, have all the JS syntax highlighting, flycheck, etc;
  - you can edit GitHub issues and wiki pages using markdown-mode and use your syntax checker and thesaurus;
  - quickly modify url in browser address bar using multiple-cursors and regexp-replace things;
  - edit and modify code snippets with ease in Slack;
  - etc. and etc.

* Keybindings
  Default keybindings are just like in Org-mode (for editing source blocks):

  ~C-c '​~ or ~C-c C-'​~  - edit

  ~C-c '​~ or ~C-c C-c~  - finish editing

  ~C-c C-k~ - cancel editing
* Customization
  You can use hooks to set desired mode, etc, e.g.:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package exwm-edit
      :config
      (defun ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose ()
        (spacemacs/toggle-visual-line-navigation-on)
        (funcall 'markdown-mode))

      (add-hook 'exwm-edit-compose-hook 'ag-exwm/on-exwm-edit-compose))
  #+end_src
