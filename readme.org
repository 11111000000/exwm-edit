* Description
  Edit mode for [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]]

  Similar to [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]]

  except this package is made to work with EXWM
  and it works with any editable element of any app

  The idea is very simple - when you press the keybinding,
  it simulates =C-a= + =C-x= (select all & cut),
  then opens a buffer and yanks the content so you can edit it,
  after you done - it grabs (now edited text) and pastes back to where it's started

* Prerequisites
  In order for it to work properly, you're gonna need to install [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/gpastel][gpastel]]. Follow instructions for the package.

* Keybindings
  Default keybindings are just like in Org-mode:

  ~C-c 'â€‹~   - edit

  ~C-c '~   - finish editing

  ~C-c C-k~ - cancel editing
